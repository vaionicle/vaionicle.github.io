# Wiki

Welcome to my wiki page.

I am using a **modular and full featured wiki** powered by git, [github](https://pages.github.com/)/[gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/product/pages/)

---

## Getting start


You can use it with jekyll ["remote_theme"](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-remote-theme) feature or fork/copy the master branch  and start your wiki in just 1 minute*.
