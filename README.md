# git-wiki

it's a **modular and full featured wiki** powered by git, [github](https://pages.github.com/)/[gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/product/pages/) pages and pull-requests!

## Getting started

The easier and faster way to use git-wiki is the "skeleton" method.

**You don't need to install anything locally!**

1. Simply fork/clone [skeleton repo](https://github.com/Drassil/git-wiki-skeleton) or click on "Use this template" button to create your copy of the skeleton project.

2. Edit _config.yml and other pages as you need and then deploy it on github/gitlab pages.

**Done**! now wait that your page will be published and you're ready **_to wiki_**!

## Features
